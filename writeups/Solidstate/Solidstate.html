<h1>1. Recon</h1>
<h2>Nmap</h2>
<p>I started pinging the target to check if it was a Linux or a Windows system. The Time-To-Live (ttl) was 63, which is very close to 64, so it was a Linux system. Had it been close to 128 (or 128) it would have been a Windows system. After that I conducted an Nmap scan to detect active services on the target using <code>-p-</code> to scan all ports. Given that it was a Hack The Box machine (a controlled environment), I optimized the scan for speed using the following flags: <code>--min-rate 5000</code>, <code>-sS</code> for a SYN scan, <code>-Pn</code> to skip the host discovery stage, <code>-n</code> to skip reverse DNS resolution and <code>-T5</code> for higher speed.</p>
<p><img alt="image.png" src="image.png" /></p>
<p><img alt="image.png" src="image%201.png" /></p>
<p>The scan revealed the following open ports:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SSH</strong> on port 22.</li>
<li><strong>SMTP</strong> on port 25</li>
<li><strong>HTTP</strong> on port 80</li>
<li><strong>POP3</strong> on port 110</li>
<li><strong>NNTP</strong> on port 119</li>
<li><strong>RSIP</strong> on port 4555</li>
</ul>
<p>Then, I conducted a more thorough scan on those ports using service version detection (<code>-sV</code>) and the Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) with default scripts (<code>-sC</code>). I also saved the output for easy reference later (<code>-oN nmap</code>).</p>
<p><img alt="image.png" src="image%202.png" /></p>
<h2>Website - TCP 80</h2>
<p>After the scan I tried visiting the webpage to look for web vulnerabilities but the site only presented information about a cybersecurity company. However, I found a domain name in the Contact section that could be used to find sub-domains later.</p>
<p><img alt="image.png" src="image%203.png" /></p>
<p>Since the site didn’t provide any useful information, I decided to run <strong><code>Gobuster</code></strong> to brute-force directory paths. I started with the <code>common.txt</code> wordlist to quickly identify potential directories for further investigation. While analyzing those initial results, I initiated a second Gobuster scan using the more comprehensive <code>directory-list-2.3-medium.txt</code> wordlist, knowing it would take significantly longer to complete.</p>
<p><img alt="image.png" src="image%204.png" /></p>
<p>The <code>README.txt</code> file contained a message from the SolidState developer. SolidState is described as a fully responsive <code>HTML5</code> and <code>CSS3</code> site template, which didn’t appear to present any exploitable information.</p>
<p><img alt="image.png" src="image%205.png" /></p>
<p>I attempted to use <code>dig</code> to find the DNS server for the domain and then perform a zone transfer to retrieve subdomains, but the attempt was unsuccessful.</p>
<p><img alt="image.png" src="image%206.png" /></p>
<h2>2. Gaining Access</h2>
<p>Since I was unfamiliar with the <code>RSIP</code> service, I attempted to connect to it using <code>netcat</code> and discovered a login prompt, but I didn’t have the credentials. I searched for known vulnerabilities using <code>Searchsploit</code> and found two remote command execution scripts. While reviewing one of them, I came across what appeared to be the default credentials. I tried them and was able to log in successfully.</p>
<p><img alt="image.png" src="image%207.png" /></p>
<p><img alt="image.png" src="8876d472-bb29-4287-af14-6c57b15025ec.png" /></p>
<p><img alt="image.png" src="image%208.png" /></p>
<p>After gaining access, I discovered a command that allowed me to change passwords. I listed the users and modified their passwords, granting me the ability to read their emails through the <code>POP3</code> service. While reviewing the existing emails, I found one sent to the user <code>john</code> from <code>mailadmin</code>, instructing him to send a temporary password to <code>mindy</code>.</p>
<p><img alt="image.png" src="image%209.png" /></p>
<p>I then checked Mindy’s emails and found a welcome message from the company, along with the temporary credentials that John had sent her for SSH access: <code>mindy:P@55W0rd1!2@</code>.</p>
<p><img alt="image.png" src="image%2010.png" /></p>
<p>Using those credentials, I connected via SSH and successfully retrieved the user flag.</p>
<p><img alt="image.png" src="image%2011.png" /></p>
<p>Although I had access to the system, the shell was restricted to rbash (restricted Bash), limiting my access to most binaries. However, if non-interactive mode were misconfigured, I could run commands in that mode and spawn an interactive shell with Bash. I successfully exploited this misconfiguration using SSH, gaining an interactive shell that I could use to initiate the privilege escalation phase.</p>

<h1>3. Privilege Escalation</h1>
<h2>Root</h2>
<p>In my attempt to check for any sudo permissions, I discovered that the <code>sudo</code> binary was missing. I then looked for files with SUID permissions that I could use to escalate privileges, but I didn’t find any that I recognized. I continued exploring other methods before investigating any of the files further.</p>
<p><img alt="image.png" src="image%2015.png" /></p>
<p><img alt="image.png" src="image%2016.png" /></p>
<p>I started a Python HTTP server to use <code>pspy32</code> on the target, allowing me to discover services running in the background. After some time, I identified a Python script (<code>tmp.py</code>) that was being executed periodically with root privileges, so I checked if I had write access to it. Since I had the necessary permissions, I modified the script to change the Bash permissions. Once the script was executed again, I used <code>bash -p</code> to obtain a shell with root privileges and retrieve the root flag.</p>
