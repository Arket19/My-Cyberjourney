        <h1>1. Recon</h1>
        <h2>Nmap</h2>
        <p>To determine the target's operating system, I initiated a ping test. The Time-To-Live (TTL) value returned
            was 63, indicating it was a Linux system (TTL values around 128 typically suggest a Windows OS). Following
            this, I conducted an Nmap scan to identify active services on the target using the <code>-p-</code> flag to
            scan all ports. Since this is a Hack The Box machine, I optimized the scan for speed with the following
            flags:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>-min-rate 5000</code></li>
            <li><code>sS</code> (SYN scan)</li>
            <li><code>T5</code> (maximum speed)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><img alt="image.png" src="image.png" /></p>
        <p><img alt="image.png" src="image%201.png" /></p>
        <p>The scan revealed the following open ports:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>HTTP</strong> on port 80</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Next, I performed a more detailed scan on port 80 with service version detection (<code>-sV</code>) and used
            the Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) with default scripts (<code>-sC</code>). I saved the output for reference
            using the <code>-oN</code> flag.</p>
        <p><img alt="image.png" src="image%202.png" /></p>
        <h2>Website - TCP 80</h2>
        <p>After scanning for services, I utilized <code>whatweb</code> to identify the technologies used by the HTTP
            service. The web interface resembled a blog and displayed a tool called <strong>phpbash</strong>, which
            appeared to function as a web shell allowing command execution. There was an image where a directory path
            could be seen (<code>/uploads/phpbash.php</code>), but it was empty when accessed.</p>
        <p>Subsequently, I executed the following command to enumerate directories on the web server:
            <code>gobuster dir -u [http://10.10.10.68](http://10.10.10.68/) -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt -o results.txt -x html,php,py,conf,txt,log,xml,sh</code>
        </p>
        <p><img alt="image.png" src="image%203.png" /></p>
        <p><img alt="image.png" src="image%204.png" /></p>
        <p>This revealed several directories, all of which were empty or contained files that were not useful for
            further access, except for the <code>/dev/</code> directory which contained. I tested command execution and
            confirmed it ran under the <code>www-data</code> user. I then attempted to send a TCP reverse shell to my
            machine, which succeeded after URL encoding the <code>&amp;</code> symbols (%26)</p>
        <p><img alt="image.png" src="image%205.png" /></p>
        <h1>2. Gaining Access</h1>
        <p>I visited all of them and they all were empty or had files that I couldn’t use to gain access to the system.
            All but the <code>/dev/</code> directory, which had the already mentioned tool <code>phpbash</code>. I tried
            writing commands and I found it ran them as the <code>www-data</code> user. So I tried sending a TCP
            revershe shell to my own system which finally worked when I URL encoded the &amp;’s (%26).</p>
        <p><img alt="image.png" src="image%206.png" /></p>
        <p><img alt="image.png" src="image%207.png" /></p>
        <p>After gaining access to the system, I spawned a fully upgraded TTY to maintain the connection more
            effectively. This was accomplished using the following commands:</p>
        <p><code>python
script /dev/null -c bash #Starts a new shell session without logging.
^Z #Pauses the new shell.
stty raw -echo;fg #Sets the terminal to raw mode, unsets echoing, and then brings the shell back.
reset #Resets the terminal to a sane state.
xterm #Sets the terminal type.
export TERM=xterm #Definition of necessary environment variables.
export SHELL=bash
stty rows 59 columns 116 #Definition of the window size.</code></p>
        <p><img alt="image.png" src="image%208.png" /></p>
        <p>With a stable TTY, I navigated to retrieve the user flag and then checked the sudo permissions. I discovered
            that I could execute commands as the user <code>scriptmanager</code>, prompting me to start a shell as that
            user.</p>
        <p><img alt="image.png" src="image%209.png" /></p>
        <p><img alt="image.png" src="image%2010.png" /></p>
        <h1>3. Privilege Escalation</h1>
        <h2>Root</h2>
        <p>After switching users, I downloaded <strong>pspy</strong> to monitor the running processes. After observing
            for a while, I noted that the file <code>test.py</code> was executed periodically.</p>
        <p><img alt="image.png" src="image%2011.png" /></p>
        <p><img alt="image.png" src="image%2012.png" /></p>
        <p>I located <code>test.py</code> by following its path to the <code>/scripts/</code> directory. Upon listing
            its contents, I found that the user <code>scriptmanager</code> owned <code>test.py</code>, which meant I
            could modify its contents to execute arbitrary commands as the user running it (UID=0, root).</p>
        <p><img alt="image.png" src="image%2013.png" /></p>
        <p><img alt="image.png" src="image%2014.png" /></p>
        <p>To exploit this, I edited <code>test.py</code> to change the permissions of <code>/bin/bash</code> when the
            script was executed. This modification allowed me to run <strong>bash</strong> as its owner (root) after the
            next execution of <code>test.py</code>.</p>
        <p><img alt="image.png" src="image%2015.png" /></p>
        <p><img alt="image.png" src="image%2016.png" /></p>
        <p>Finally, I was able to access the <code>root</code> user and capture the root flag.</p>
