        "text": "These past two weeks, I have been studying my master's first two modules: Introduction to Cybersecurity and Cybersecurity Architecture. The content of these modules has been mainly theoretical, and there haven’t been any practical exercises. However, I consider them just as important as the upcoming modules that will include labs and projects. This is because understanding how a company’s cybersecurity department is structured and what its objectives and duties are is essential. I believe this has given me the necessary context for applying practical skills effectively in future modules. <br><br>Although I haven’t practiced pentesting in HTB as I have been doing for the past four months, I have been working on a new and fascinating project that I will be uploading here in a couple of months :) ",
